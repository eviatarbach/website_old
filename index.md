I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park in the <a href="https://www.atmos.umd.edu/">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ekalnay/">Eugenia Kalnay</a>. Prior to this I was an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia, studying computer science, physics, and mathematics.

My research interests include dynamical systems, data assimilation, climate dynamics, and machine learning.
