title: Google Summer of Code introduction
---

'm excited to have been chosen for Google Summer of Code 2013! I'm going to be working on [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) under the mentorship of [Flavia Stan](http://flavias.net/) and [Burcin Erocal](http://erocal.org/burcin/). You can see my proposal on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZOvfjngJrc97BpIpSvaSnKxJG8y01d1TW9rVdB2x4GE/edit?usp=sharing).

I'm going to be posting updates on the project on this blog.
